# Prospect Garage

Shopping for a vehicle online can be difficult if you don't have proper organization. Multiple tabs in your browser window, cluttered information, and constant tabbing back and forth while comparing. All of this can make vehicle research seem frustratingly jumbled. `Prospect Garage` looks to change that by organizing all of your vehicle research information in one place. Create "`Car Cards`" that contain information about vehicles you are interested in such as Price, Location, Miles, Link to the original ad, etc.

Next time you are shopping for a vehicle online play with a stacked deck and use `Prospect Garage` for your organizational needs.
